# Project Checkpoints

## Step 1 - Schema Updates
- `schema.prisma` extended with `ResourceRole`, `RolePermissionMap`, and `UserResourceRole` models.
- Migration `add_resource_rbac_models` applied successfully.
- `prisma/seed.ts` updated to include sample data for new models and made idempotent using `upsert`.
- Build passes.
- Tests pass.

## Step 2 - Permission Tests
- Created `tests/resources.test.ts` with failing tests for resource-based RBAC endpoints.
- Added test cases:
    - `should be able to give an existing role to a new user and then map the user to an existing resource`
    - `should be able to give an existing user a different role for a different resource`
- Build passes.
- Tests fail (red state).

## Step 3 - Implement Schema + Seed Logic
- Prisma models defined in Step 1 were implemented and migrated.
- `prisma/seed.ts` was extended in Step 1 to include sample resource-based roles, map permissions, and assign users to roles.
- Build passes.
- Tests pass (existing tests) and new tests fail (as expected).

## Step 4 - Complete Resource-Based RBAC Implementation
- **Routes and Controllers**: Created `src/routes/resources.routes.ts` and `src/controllers/resource.controller.ts` with complete resource-based RBAC endpoints.
- **Service Layer**: Implemented `src/services/resource.service.ts` with methods for:
  - Creating resource roles with permissions
  - Assigning/unassigning users to resource roles
  - Retrieving user permissions for specific resources
- **Validation**: Added `src/schemas/resource.schema.ts` with Zod validation schemas for all resource endpoints.
- **Middleware**: Enhanced `src/middleware/rbac.middleware.ts` with `authorizeResource` middleware for resource-specific permission checks.
- **Test Implementation**: Completed all test cases in `tests/resources.test.ts` including middleware authorization tests.
- **Integration**: Updated all index files and `app.ts` to register new routes and exports.
- **Results**: All 19 resource-based RBAC tests pass, all existing tests continue to pass (91 total tests passing).

### Implemented Endpoints:
- `POST /resources/:resourceType/:resourceId/roles` - Create resource-specific roles
- `POST /resources/:resourceType/:resourceId/roles/:roleId/assign` - Assign users to resource roles
- `DELETE /resources/:resourceType/:resourceId/roles/:roleId/assign/:userId` - Remove user role assignments
- `GET /resources/:resourceType/:resourceId/users/:userId/permissions` - Get user permissions for a resource
- `GET /resources/:resourceType/:resourceId/test-read` - Test endpoint for read permission middleware
- `POST /resources/:resourceType/:resourceId/test-write` - Test endpoint for write permission middleware

### Key Features Implemented:
✅ Role-based access control at the resource level  
✅ User can have multiple resources  
✅ User can only have one role per resource  
✅ Permissions are verb-based (read, write, update, delete, etc.)  
✅ Complete test coverage including middleware authorization  
✅ Proper error handling and validation  
✅ Database constraints ensure data integrity  

**Status**: Resource-based RBAC fully implemented and tested. Ready for production use.

## Email Verification - Step 4 - VERIFICATION ENDPOINT
- Created `POST /api/auth/verify/{verificationCode}` endpoint accessible without authentication
- Added `verifyEmail` function to `src/services/auth.service.ts` with comprehensive validation:
  - Checks if verification code exists, is not expired (15min limit), and not already used
  - Updates UserVerification status: isEmailVerified=true, emailVerificationDate=current timestamp, verificationStatus='verified', userStatus='active'
  - Updates User status to active (isActive=true)
  - Marks verification code as used (isUsed=true)

- Email sending is wrapped in try-catch to ensure registration succeeds even if email delivery fails (graceful degradation)
- Users are created with `isActive: false` initially and remain unverified until they verify their email
- Build passes
- Tests pass (72/72)
- Registration now automatically triggers verification email workflow

**Status**: Email verification fully integrated with registration process. Ready for end-to-end testing.

## Email Verification - Step 6 - VERIFICATION EMAIL RESEND
- Implemented `POST /api/auth/resend-verification` endpoint for resending verification emails
- Added `resendVerification` function to `src/services/auth.service.ts` with intelligent code reuse logic:
  - Checks if user exists and is not already verified
  - Finds valid (non-expired, unused) verification codes and reuses them
  - Generates new verification codes if existing ones are expired or used
  - Sends verification emails with retry logic
- Added `resendVerification` controller to `src/controllers/auth.controller.ts` with proper logging and error handling
- Added route to `src/routes/auth.routes.ts` with Swagger documentation and validation
- Added `resendVerificationSchema` to `src/schemas/auth.schema.ts` for email validation
- Added comprehensive test suite in `tests/auth-endpoints.test.ts`:
  - `should resend verification email with valid existing code` - Tests code reuse for valid codes
  - `should resend verification email with new code when existing code is expired` - Tests new code generation for expired codes
  - `should resend verification email with new code when existing code is used` - Tests new code generation for used codes
  - `should reject resend for already verified user` - Tests rejection of verified users
  - `should handle resend verification errors gracefully` - Tests error handling for invalid emails

- Complete email verification system with resend functionality validated

**Status**: Email verification system fully implemented with resend capability, tested, and production-ready. All 6 steps completed successfully following TDD principles.

## Email Verification - Step 7 - VERIFICATION CODE NOT FOUND
- Added comprehensive test case for the scenario where no verification code exists for a user during resend request
- Test `should resend verification email when no verification code exists` verifies that:
  - When a user exists but has no EmailVerificationCode records
  - The resend endpoint generates a new verification code
  - Sends the verification email successfully
  - Creates exactly one new verification code record
- Verified that existing `resendVerification` function already handles this case correctly:
  - When `existingCodes` array is empty, it calls `generateVerificationCode(user.id)` to create a new code
  - The new code is then used to send the verification email
- Test passes and validates the edge case handling
- All tests continue to pass (88/88 total tests)
- Build succeeds

**Status**: Email verification system fully implemented with comprehensive edge case handling, tested, and production-ready. All 7 steps completed successfully following TDD principles.

## Step 6 - Add `username` as part of the JWT payload
