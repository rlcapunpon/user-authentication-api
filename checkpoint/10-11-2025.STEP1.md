# Step 10-11-2025.STEP1 - Soft Delete Resource Name Modification

## Overview
Successfully implemented Step 10-11-2025.STEP1 to enhance soft delete functionality by appending "(DELETED )" and current date to resource names when marking resources as deleted. This allows resource names to be reused without conflicts while maintaining audit trail of deleted resources.

## Changes Made

### 1. RBAC Service Enhancement (`src/services/rbac.service.ts`)
- Updated `softDeleteResource()` function to use atomic transaction
- Added resource name modification logic: `resource.name + "(DELETED )" + currentDate`
- Uses `prisma.$transaction()` to ensure both name update and status change are atomic
- Prevents resource name conflicts when reusing deleted resource names

### 2. Test Suite Updates
Added comprehensive TDD tests for the new soft delete behavior:

- **`tests/resources-endpoints.test.ts`**: Added test "should append "(DELETED )" and current date to resource name when soft deleting"
- **`tests/internal-endpoints.test.ts`**: Added test "should append "(DELETED )" and current date to resource name when soft deleting via internal endpoint"
- **`tests/internal-endpoints.test.ts`**: Updated existing test to expect modified resource name "Resource 1 (DELETED 2025-10-11)" instead of "Resource 1"

### 3. Transaction Safety
- Implemented atomic database transactions using `prisma.$transaction()`
- Ensures resource name and status are updated together or not at all
- Prevents partial updates that could leave data in inconsistent state

## Key Technical Details

### Soft Delete Logic
- **Before**: Only updated ResourceStatus to DELETED, resource name remained unchanged
- **After**: Updates both ResourceStatus to DELETED AND modifies resource name with "(DELETED )" + current date
- **Format**: `Original Name (DELETED YYYY-MM-DD)`
- **Example**: `"My Resource" → "My Resource (DELETED 2025-10-11)"`

### Transaction Implementation
```typescript
await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  await tx.resourceStatus.update({
    where: { resourceId },
    data: { status: 'DELETED' }
  });
  
  await tx.resource.update({
    where: { id: resourceId },
    data: { name: `${resource.name} (DELETED ${currentDate})` }
  });
});
```

### Test Coverage
- **Regular DELETE endpoint**: Tests name modification for JWT-authenticated requests
- **Internal DELETE endpoint**: Tests name modification for API key authenticated requests
- **Existing functionality**: Verifies that other endpoints properly handle modified resource names

## Validation Results
✅ All 55 tests passing in resources-endpoints.test.ts
✅ All 32 tests passing in internal-endpoints.test.ts
✅ TypeScript compilation successful (npm run build)
✅ Resource name reuse now possible without conflicts
✅ Audit trail maintained for deleted resources

## Files Modified
- `src/services/rbac.service.ts` - Enhanced softDeleteResource function
- `tests/resources-endpoints.test.ts` - Added new test for name modification
- `tests/internal-endpoints.test.ts` - Added new test and updated existing test expectations

## Next Steps
Step 10-11-2025.STEP1 implementation is complete. Resources can now be soft deleted with modified names that prevent reuse conflicts while maintaining clear audit trails of deletion dates.
